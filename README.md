# MIT-Picture
A probabilistic programming language for visual scene perception

### Requirements
* Julia (http://julialang.org/downloads/)
* Python (optinal)
* MATLAB (optional)

### Quick Start
```python
cd <repo>/programs
julia <program-name>.jl
```
Only developers should touch the <repo>/engine folder. Any probabilistic program should reside in <repo>/programs. Please see demo programs to learn how to get started. The demo programs are quite easy to follow. Once the system is mature, I will probably put out a brief paper describing the system. Please note that this system is under heavy initial development and has a lot of known bugs. Use at your own risk.
